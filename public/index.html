      <p>Parrot is a an HTTP API to consume limited information from multiple social platforms. The design is
        intentionally simple
        and transparent. There's really only one endpoint.</p>
      <p class="code"><code>GET https://parrot.crz.li/&lt;platform&gt;/&lt;username&gt;.&lt;format&gt</code></p>
      <p>The response comprises that user's latest activity on that platform in the desired format. For instance,
        if we were to make a request to.</p>
      <p class="code"><code>GET https://parrot.crz.li/twitter/geoffkeighley.html</code></p>
      <p>Parrot would hit the Twitter API, authenticates, get an access token, fetch the latest status from <a href="https://twitter.com/geoffkeighley">@geoffkeighley</a>
        and return it in format appropriate to be
        embedded in HTML.
        <p class="code">
          <code>
            HTTP/1.1 200 OK<br>
            Content-Type: text/html; charset=utf-8<br><br>
            Exactly 3 months until &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/thegameawards"&gt;@thegameawards&lt;/a&gt; - can’t believe the show that’s coming together this year!

        <p>Some platforms may require additional authentication to work. Such is the case of Instagram which requires
          the owner of the data to give <strong>explicit permission</strong> to have their data read by Parrot.</p>
        <p>The process is as simple as it can be;</p>
        <ol>
          <li>A request to an unauthenticated profile will get a redirection to the platform's authentication screen.</li>
          <li>From there you will be redirected back to Parrot and the process will be completed.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Subsequent requests will now fetch and return the expected results. Please note that although we momentarily
          cache data to avoid service interruption this authorization will eventually <strong>expire</strong> and it's
          the user's responsibility to <strong>repeat the authentication procedure</strong>.</p>

      </h2>
      <h3>What is Parrot?</h3>
      <p>Parrot is a service that fetches your latest activity on social media to have it embedded
        elsewhere, like on your blog for instance.</p>
      <h3>How much does it cost?</h3>
      <p>Currently Parrot is free of charge. As the product matures we might have to find ways to
        make it sustainable.</p>
      <h3>What platforms does it work with?</h3>
      <p>Right now it’s just Twitter. We’re actively working on integrating more platforms such as
        Instagram.</p>
      <h3>What are the limitations?</h3>
      <p>There are some. Not only because of limitations of the platform itself, but also because
        of how Parrot was designed. First of all it only works with public data. The content must be cached for a small
        amount of time (minutes usually, an hour at most) so it’s not in real-time. Also we don’t store historical
        data, so once the cache is refreshed the previous content is automatically discarded.</p>
